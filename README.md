# 🏗 Twinmotion 3D Visualization Project

This repository showcases a *3D architectural visualization project* designed and rendered using *Twinmotion*.  
The project focuses on creating a *modern site layout* with attention to aesthetics, lighting, circulation, and landscaping.

## 🖼 Project Overview

This visualization demonstrates:
- A well-organized *parking layout* for cars and bikes  
- *Modern architectural structures* with a clean color palette  
- *Street lighting elements* to enhance ambience and realism  
- *Greenery and trees* for sustainable and aesthetic design  
- *Optimized spatial flow* for pedestrian and vehicle movement
